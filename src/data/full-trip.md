# **Day-by-day itinerary**

## **Fri Apr 3 — Arrival + Redwoods + Yountville**

Arrive in Northern California and ease into the trip with a redwood walk at Muir Woods, then settle into Yountville for the first taste of Napa's culinary heart. It's a gentle start that balances travel with a classic landscape and a relaxed evening to recharge.

**10:45am–12:15pm — Land at SFO + rental car + lunch to-go**  

Land at SFO, pick up the rental car, and keep lunch simple (airport or a quick stop in Mill Valley) so you're fueled before the redwoods. This block stays intentionally flexible for baggage, the rental car shuttle, and a quick pharmacy/snack run if you want it.  

*Travel (drive): ~1 hr — SFO → Muir Woods*

**1:15pm–3:00pm — Muir Woods National Monument (Main Trail)**  

Walk the mostly flat, shaded [Main Trail](https://www.nps.gov/goga/planyourvisit/muir-woods-main-trail.htm) for an easy introduction to California's coastal redwoods—a short out-and-back or a longer stroll depending on your legs after travel. The grove is one of the last surviving old-growth coastal redwood stands, protected as a national monument in 1908 after a campaign by William Kent, who donated the land specifically to block a dam project. Bring a light layer; it stays cool under the canopy even on warm days.

*Travel (drive): ~1 hr — Muir Woods → The Estate Yountville*

**4:00pm — Arrive + check-in at The Estate Yountville**  

Arrive at **The Estate Yountville** and settle into your King Guestroom on the Vintage Estate, with easy access to the property's gardens, spa/pool, and Yountville's walkable main strip. The Vintage Estate buildings and grounds have that classic Napa feel, and the room's balcony makes a great place to decompress after the travel day. Yountville is Napa's small-town culinary hub, known for its concentration of standout restaurants.  

**6:00pm — Dinner at Bottega Napa Valley**

Dinner at **Bottega**, Michael Chiarello's Italian-Californian kitchen—rustic handmade pastas and wood-fired dishes rooted in California produce, rendered through the lens of his Italian heritage. The menu rotates seasonally but stays true to those fundamentals, and the atmosphere is composed without being fussy. Conveniently located right on The Estate property, so there's no car needed after a long travel day.

## **Sat Apr 4 — Napa’s Natural Bounty**

Today is Napa at its most farm-to-table—market browsing, an olive oil tasting, a gondola-view winery stop, and a relaxed dinner in St. Helena.

**9:30am–10:45am — Napa Farmers Market (downtown Napa)**  

Browse local produce, breads, cheeses, and small artisan vendors at the Napa Farmers Market—a lively, year-round operation and a good snapshot of what's in season in the valley. An easy, open-air stop with plenty of options for tasting and picking up a snack for the road.

*Travel (drive): ~30 min — downtown Napa → Round Pond (Rutherford)*

**11:30am–1:00pm — Round Pond: Olive Oil Gourmet Experience**  

Round Pond is one of only two functioning olive mills in Napa Valley, pressing five Italian and three Spanish olive varieties hand-harvested and cold-pressed on-site at their 468-acre Rutherford estate. The Gourmet Experience is a structured, seated tasting—walked through like a wine tasting, with aroma and palate assessment—paired with seasonal bites from the estate kitchen. It's genuinely educational without being dry, and a nice contrast to the wine tastings surrounding it.

*Travel (drive): ~20 min — Round Pond (Rutherford) → The Estate Yountville*

**1:00pm — Return to the hotel for lunch + downtime**  

Head back to Yountville for a simple lunch and a real break in the day. Use this window for pool/spa time, a walk around The Estate, or just getting ready for the afternoon tasting.

*Travel (drive): ~25 min — The Estate Yountville → Sterling Vineyards (Calistoga)*

**4:15pm–5:15pm — Sterling Vineyards tasting + gondola ride**  

Ride the gondola up to Sterling's whitewashed, Mykonos-inspired winery—perched on a 300-foot knoll above Calistoga—for a self-guided tasting of five wines with sweeping valley views. The aerial gondola opened in 1973 as the first at any winery in the world; the current cars were installed after the winery rebuilt following the 2020 Glass Fire. Plan on some walking around the hilltop, so comfortable shoes and a light layer are helpful.

*Travel (drive): ~20 min — Sterling Vineyards (Calistoga) → Farmstead (St. Helena)*

**6:00pm — Dinner at Farmstead at Long Meadow Ranch**  

Farmstead is the restaurant arm of Long Meadow Ranch, whose land dates to an 1872 patent grant signed by Ulysses S. Grant—now a genuinely integrated operation raising grass-fed beef, growing organic produce, and pressing estate olive oil, much of which feeds directly into the kitchen. The food is American farmhouse cooking: live-fire preparations, seasonal vegetables, and ranch-raised proteins, served inside a restored 19th-century barn on Main Street in St. Helena. Polished but relaxed—a good anchor for a long Napa evening.

*Travel (drive): ~15 min — Farmstead (St. Helena) → The Estate Yountville*

**8:00pm — Return to the hotel**  

Return to The Estate for an easy wind-down and a good night's sleep.

## **Sun Apr 5 — Napa’s Wine Culture**

Lean into Napa's wine culture with the Oxbow market, the historic Schramsberg caves, and a flexible afternoon before a celebratory dinner. 

**9:00am–10:15am — Oxbow Public Market**  

Make a casual stop at Oxbow for coffee and pastries, plus a few easy tastings. Opened in 2007 as a 40,000-square-foot food hall along the Napa River, it's credited with helping kick-start the revival of downtown Napa as a destination; anchor tenants include Hog Island Oyster Co. (the only Napa outpost of the famous Tomales Bay operation) and a good cheese-and-wine counter. Mostly indoors, easy to navigate, and good for a quick graze or a slower sit by the river.

*Travel (drive): ~35 min — Oxbow Public Market (Napa) → Schramsberg (Calistoga)*

**11:00am–12:30pm — Schramsberg Vineyards Cave Tour (Susan + Ted)**  

Take the classic Schramsberg cave tour—a guided walk through cool underground cellars built by Chinese laborers in the 1860s, with a structured tasting of Schramsberg sparkling and Davies wines plus a cheese and charcuterie accompaniment. Schramsberg was founded in 1862, making it one of Napa's oldest wineries; it earned lasting fame in 1972 when Nixon served its Blanc de Blancs at the historic "Toast to Peace" dinner in China. The caves run genuinely chilly year-round, so pack a sweater—and plan for Dan, Jen, and Ava to stay flexible in Yountville while you're on the tour.

*Travel (drive): ~35 min — Schramsberg (Calistoga) → The Estate Yountville*

**1:00pm–3:30pm — Couples massage / pool time / relaxed hotel wandering (Susan + Ted)**  

Return to The Estate for a true downtime block—massage (if scheduled), pool time, a quiet walk around the property, or simply resting in your room. This is intentionally open so you can adjust based on how you're feeling.

*Travel (drive): ~15 min — The Estate Yountville → V. Sattui (St. Helena)*

**4:00pm–5:00pm — V. Sattui tasting + lawn time**  

Head to V. Sattui for a seated tasting for you and Ted—five Premier and Estate wines, with an option to add the single-vineyard Cabernet flight—while Dan, Jen, and Ava spread out on the open lawns. The winery sells exclusively through its own tasting room (no retail distribution), and is known for a deli and cheese counter that's made picnicking on the property something of an institution here.

*Travel (drive): ~25 min — V. Sattui (St. Helena) → Ad Hoc*

**5:45pm — Dinner at Ad Hoc**  

Dinner at **Ad Hoc**, Thomas Keller's family-style restaurant on Washington Street in Yountville—a deliberately casual counterpart to The French Laundry, serving a single four-course prix fixe menu that changes nightly. The format is communal and generous: big platters of seasonal, comfort-driven cooking served family-style to the table. It's a quintessential Yountville experience and a great celebratory dinner for the whole group before packing up for Yosemite.

**After dinner — Return to the hotel + pack for Yosemite**  

Return to The Estate and pack for an early start and a longer drive day, keeping the morning setup easy (layers, comfortable shoes, and snacks/water for the car).

## **Mon Apr 6 — To Yosemite + Lodge Settle-In**

Leave wine country behind and head for the Sierra. Rush Creek Lodge is a comfortable base just outside Yosemite’s Big Oak Flat Entrance on CA-120—close enough for an early start tomorrow, but relaxing enough to feel like a destination on its own (pool/hot tubs, fire pits, easy on-property trails).

**8:30am–1:00pm — Drive Yountville → Rush Creek Lodge (Yosemite area)**  

Expect about a 4.5-hour drive that gradually trades vineyard rows for rolling foothills and then piney mountain terrain. A lunch stop in Oakdale or Groveland (both classic Sierra gateway towns) is an easy way to break up the day—and a nice introduction to the region’s Gold Rush and park-gateway history.  

*Travel (drive): ~4 hr 30 min — Yountville → Rush Creek Lodge*

**1:00pm — Arrive at Rush Creek Lodge + lunch**  

Arrive at Rush Creek Lodge, check in, and enjoy lunch on-site. Think “mountain camp, upgraded”: a warm lodge atmosphere, outdoor gathering spots, and just enough nature right on the property to start feeling like you’ve arrived in Yosemite country.

**2:30pm–4:00pm — Unpack + lodge decompression**  

Settle in with a low-key block to unpack, rest, and reset after the drive. Use it for a short property walk, the pool/hot tub, or simply downtime in the room.

**4:30pm–5:30pm — Easy nature walk (Nature Trail or Vista Trail)**  

Take an easy on-property walk—either the [Nature Trail (0.5 mi) or the Vista Trail (1.6 mi)](https://www.rushcreeklodge.com/explore/activities/nature-trails/). Both are low-commitment, high-reward: classic Sierra forest, gentle grades, and enough quiet to shake off the travel day.

**5:30pm — Dinner at The Restaurant at Rush Creek**  

Have dinner on-site—an easy, satisfying basecamp dinner before tomorrow’s Yosemite day. Expect seasonal California-style cooking and plenty of options that work whether you want something hearty or something lighter.

**Evening — S’mores + fire pits + stargazing**  

Wrap up the day by walking the property, doing one of the craft activities offered by the hotel, enjoying s'mores at the lodge fire pits while doing a little stargazing.

## **Tue Apr 7 — Yosemite Valley Highlights**

A full Yosemite Valley day built around the classics: the iconic Tunnel View reveal, two short waterfall walks, a meadow loop with huge granite walls in every direction, and a ranger-led Valley Floor Tour for context. Expect roughly 2–3 miles of mostly flat walking spread across the day, with lots of natural stopping points for photos and rests.

**8:15am — Drive to Yosemite Valley**  

Drive into Yosemite Valley as the scenery shifts from forested slopes to sheer granite walls. The Valley is famously glacially carved, which is why it opens up so dramatically and feels built for views.  

*Travel (drive): ~1 hr 15 min — Rush Creek Lodge → Yosemite Valley*

**9:30am — Tunnel View**  

Stop at Tunnel View for Yosemite’s most famous overlook—El Capitan, Bridalveil Fall, and **Half Dome** all in one sweep. The viewpoint became iconic after the Wawona Tunnel opened in the 1930s, and it’s still the classic “first big reveal” spot in the Valley.

**10:00am–10:45am — Bridalveil Fall Trail (0.5mi)**

Walk the short, mostly paved trail to Bridalveil Fall—620 feet of free-falling water known to the valley's Ahwahneechee people as *Pohono*, "puffing wind," for the way breezes deflect the lower cascade. In April, the flow is typically strong and the mist at the base can be intense; bring a light layer.

**11:30am–12:30pm — Lower Yosemite Falls Loop (1mi)**

Do the 1-mile paved loop to Lower Yosemite Fall—easy walking with a huge payoff. Yosemite Falls is the tallest waterfall in North America at 2,425 feet total; the lower fall alone is 320 feet, and spring snowmelt makes it loud, fast, and genuinely misty at close range.

**1:00pm — Lunch / picnic at Yosemite Village**  

Take a midday reset with a simple picnic lunch and a wander through Yosemite Village. This is the Valley’s historic hub for small exhibits, browsing shops, and soaking in the human side of Yosemite’s story alongside the scenery.

**2:00pm–4:00pm — Valley Floor Tram Tour**

Take the open-air, ranger-led Valley Floor Tour (about 2 hours) to cover more ground with minimal walking. It’s the best way to turn the scenery into a narrative—glacial geology, early conservation history, and the “how is that even possible?” scale of places like El Capitan.

**4:15pm — Sentinel Bridge**  

Stop at Sentinel Bridge for a classic Half Dome viewpoint with the Merced River often adding reflections. It’s a longtime photographer favorite, especially later in the day when the light starts to soften.

**4:45pm–5:30pm — Cook’s Meadow Loop**  

Take a flat, easy loop through Cook's Meadow (about a mile) for wide-open Valley views—meadow, river, and granite walls all in one frame with minimal walking. One of the best low-effort places to feel the full scale of the Valley, and a good spot for a few final photos before dinner.

**5:30pm — Dinner at The Mountain Room (Yosemite)**  

Have dinner at The Mountain Room at Yosemite Valley Lodge—the dining room's floor-to-ceiling windows face Yosemite Falls directly, and the walls display photographs curated in partnership with the Ansel Adams Gallery. The menu is American classics (steaks, sustainably sourced seafood, vegetarian options), which is exactly right after a full day in the Valley. Reserve ahead.

**Evening — Return to the lodge**  

Drive back to the lodge and keep the evening low-key at the fire pits before turning in.

## **Wed Apr 8 — To Carmel + Ocean Reset**

A scenery shift day—from granite and pines to ocean cliffs and Pacific air. Arrive in Carmel with enough time to enjoy the coastal sunset and a fresh, local dinner.

**8:00am — Drive from Rush Creek Lodge to Carmel (route-flex with stops)**  

Check out and head for the coast, with a handful of optional stops on the way: a quick pause by the Merced River, lunch in Mariposa (a well-preserved Gold Rush–era town), or a walk through Mariposa Grove's giant sequoias. The drive itself gradually trades granite peaks for rolling oak savanna and then the coastal hills—worth treating as a journey, not just transit.

*Travel (drive): ~6 hr — Rush Creek Lodge → Hyatt Carmel Highlands (with stops)*

**2:00pm–4:00pm — Arrive + check-in at Hyatt Carmel Highlands**  

Arrive at Hyatt Carmel Highlands—a clifftop retreat operating in this spot since 1917—and settle into the view: Pacific horizon, rocky coastline, and the kind of "sit and stare" atmosphere that makes the coast feel immediately restorative after Yosemite.

**6:00pm — Casual dinner in Carmel**

Drive into Carmel for dinner at Il Tegamino, a small Southern Italian trattoria tucked into the historic Court of the Golden Bough—a courtyard accessible via a passageway off Ocean Avenue—run by Neapolitan chef Giuseppe Panzuto. The menu is comfort-forward: slow-cooked ragus, house-made pastas, and a polpette (meatball) bar that includes a crab version. Cozy and family-run, with courtyard seating among lemon trees—a good, relaxed way to arrive on the coast.

**Evening — Waves + sunset from the balcony**  

Keep the evening simple—balcony time, sunset, and an early night after a long drive.

## **Thu Apr 9 — Big Sur on Highway 1**

Spend a full Big Sur day on Highway 1: an out-and-back with cliffside viewpoints, an easy bluff walk, a scenic lunch, and a redwood river stroll in the afternoon. The Big Sur section of Highway 1—completed in the 1930s—opened this coastline to road travelers, and it still feels like one of the world's great “scenic drive” experiences.

**9:30am — Scenic Highway 1 drive (optional pull-offs)**  

Drive south on Highway 1 and treat the first hour as a sampler of pull-offs. Quick favorites include Rocky Creek Bridge (granite headlands and big water) and Garrapata Bluff (short cliff-top walking with wide-open coastline).

*Travel (drive): ~1 hr — Carmel Highlands → Andrew Molera State Park (with optional pull-offs)*

**10:30am–12:00pm — Andrew Molera State Park: Bluff Trail (2-3mi)**  

Walk the Bluff Trail at Andrew Molera—a mostly flat out-and-back through open grasslands and coastal scrub, roughly 2–3 miles depending on where you turn around. Big Sur at its most expansive: lots of sky, long sightlines to the water, and none of the forest enclosure you get deeper in the park.

*Travel (drive): ~15 min — Andrew Molera State Park → Ventana Big Sur (Sur House)*

**12:30pm–1:30pm — Lunch at The Sur House at Ventana Big Sur**  

Have lunch at The Sur House at Ventana Big Sur—a redwood-shaded hillside setting with Pacific air drifting in, which captures Big Sur's "forest meets ocean" personality in one spot. The kitchen leans into locally sourced, California-forward cooking in a setting that makes the meal feel like part of the landscape.

*Travel (drive): ~10 min — Ventana Big Sur (Sur House) → Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park*

**1:45pm–2:45pm — Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park: Redwood River Walk**  

Switch from cliff views to redwoods with an easy river walk in Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park. Plan on a gentle stroll beneath towering redwoods along the Big Sur River—cooler, quieter, and a perfect contrast to the open bluffs.

**2:45pm–4:00pm — Scenic drive back north**  

Head back north toward Carmel Highlands with an optional stop at Bixby Creek Bridge—completed in 1932 and now one of the defining images of Highway 1. It’s a quick stop with a big payoff: rugged coastline, deep canyon, and the bridge’s graceful concrete arch all in one frame.

**4:00pm — Return to the hotel: pool time + sunset wine + showers**  

Return to the hotel for pool time (if you want it), showers, and a short rest before dinner.

**Evening — Dinner at the hotel: Pacific’s Edge (Hyatt Carmel Highlands)**  

Dinner at **Pacific's Edge**, the Hyatt's clifftop restaurant at roughly 400 feet elevation with unobstructed sightlines down the Big Sur coastline—the view is the dominant feature of any meal here. The kitchen focuses on seasonal California coastal cooking with an emphasis on local seafood; the wine program has been ranked among Wine Spectator's top 20 in the country. Start with a cocktail on the terrace if weather allows.

## **Fri Apr 10 — Point Lobos + Carmel + Farewell Dinner**

A coastal favorites day with Point Lobos, Carmel-by-the-Sea, and the 17-Mile Drive, capped by a sunset dinner at Mission Ranch. It's a relaxed, celebratory wrap for the Monterey Peninsula with plenty of time to pause and enjoy the views.

**8:00am — Point Lobos State Reserve (South Shore Trail route)**  

Visit Point Lobos—often called the crown jewel of California’s state parks—for a morning of coves, headlands, and constant ocean views. A great route is to park at Piney Woods and connect South Shore Trail → Sand Hill Trail → Sea Lion Point (with the option to add Cypress Grove). Plan on roughly 2–3 miles of easy-to-moderate walking with time built in for wildlife watching (sea lions, seabirds, and often sea otters offshore).

*Travel (drive): ~15 min — Point Lobos → Carmel-by-the-Sea*

**11:00am–2:00pm — Carmel-by-the-Sea Classic Food Tour**

Join a guided walking tour through Carmel's cottage-lined streets, with five or six tastings at local eateries and shops along the way. Stops vary but typically include a wine tasting, a chocolate shop, and a mix of Carmel's better-known and off-the-beaten-path spots—the kind of places you'd otherwise walk right past. The format is small-group and the guide weaves in Carmel's history and architecture as you go: the arts colony roots, the no-traffic-lights-or-streetlights quirks, the European village layout that makes it feel unlike anywhere else in California.

*Travel (drive): ~15 min — Carmel-by-the-Sea → Carmel Highlands*

**2:15pm — Return to the hotel for rest + balcony downtime + light packing**

Go back to the hotel for a real rest block and light packing. It's also a perfect "sit and look at the ocean" window—the kind of quiet time that makes the trip feel like a celebration, not a checklist.

*Travel (drive): ~25 min — Carmel Highlands → Pebble Beach gate*

**3:30pm — Pebble Beach 17-Mile Drive (golden light loop)**  

Drive the 17-Mile Drive loop in late-day light—a privately maintained road with a modest entry fee (usually waived with any restaurant stop)—pausing for pull-offs like Lone Cypress (one of the most photographed trees in North America) and the surf break at Spanish Bay. It's a curated coastline loop through forest, rocky shore, and famous golf links, and the late-afternoon light makes it considerably better than a midday drive.

*Travel (drive): ~15 min — Pebble Beach → Mission Ranch (Carmel)*

**5:30pm — Mission Ranch: join the text waitlist + wander**  

Arrive at **Mission Ranch**, a 22-acre ranch and restaurant dating to the 1850s—Clint Eastwood bought it in 1986 specifically to prevent it from being converted into condominiums, and undertook a careful restoration while filming *Unforgiven*. Get on the dinner waitlist, then wander the property: sheep in the pasture, a lagoon walk, and live piano in the lounge.

**6:00pm — Dinner at Mission Ranch**  

The menu leans classic American—grilled meats, fresh seafood, comfort-style sides—served in a dining room that looks out over the sheep meadow toward the Pacific sand dunes and, on a clear evening, Point Lobos. As the celebratory dinner for the trip, the setting carries real weight.

**7:00pm — Return to the hotel for a quiet night + packing**  

Return to the hotel for a quiet evening and packing.

## **Sat Apr 11 — Travel Home**

A simple travel-home day with a calm morning, a straight shot to SFO, and plenty of buffer at the airport. It's an easy finish that keeps the return smooth and stress-free.

**10:00am — Depart Carmel Highlands**  

Check out and head to SFO, with one last look at the coastline on the way out.

*Travel (drive): ~2 hr — Carmel Highlands → SFO*

**12:00pm — Arrive SFO + return the rental car**  

Return the car, grab a snack if you want, and head to the gate with plenty of time for security and boarding.

**2:00pm — Flight home**  

Fly home with big sights, photos and stories from your California journey.
